FIT2D is both a general purpose and specialist 1 and 2 dimensional data analysis program. FIT2D is used for both interactive and ``batch'' data processing.

FIT2D was developed at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (https://www.esrf.eu) up until 2018. ESRF has stopped maintaining FIT2D since 2019.

This repository makes the most recent version of the source code available to the community as open source under the MIT licence for reference purposes and for further development.
